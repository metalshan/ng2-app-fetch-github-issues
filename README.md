# ng2-app-fetch-github-issues
An application which will fetch github repo's issues. This is an Angular 2.0 demo app


### [Live demo](http://www.voidcanvas.com/demo/ng2-app-fetch-github-issues/)

## More can be done:
	* Make better error handling.
	* I didn't use DI as it was taking time to understand DI in Angular 2.
	* The regX I used has a little hack. Would like to remove that.
	* I hardly used any styling.
	* Client Id, Client secret, urls etc should be in a config file.
